\section intro Introduction

This document gives an introduction into using the ANSI C Spectral Radar SDK and demonstrates the use of the most important functions.

\subsection overview Overview

The ANSI C Spectral Radar SDK follows an object-oriented approach. 
All objects are represented by pointers where appropriate typedefs are provided for convenience. The defined types are called Handles and are used as 
Return values when created and are passed as value when used. All functionality has been created with full LabVIEW compatibility in mind and it should 
be possible to use the SDK with most other programming languages as well. 
The most important handles are given in the following sections.

\subsection sec_datahandles Data Handle (DataHandle, ColoredDataHandle, ComplexDataHandle, RawDataHandle)
Data acquired and used by the SDK is provided via data objects. A data object can contain 
- floating point data (via #DataHandle)
- complex floating point data (via #ComplexDataHandle)
- ARGB32 colored data (via #ColoredDataHandle)
- unprocessed RAW data (via #RawDataHandle)
The data objects store all information belonging to them, such as pixel data, spacing between pixels, comments attached to their data, etc.
Data objects are automatically resized if necessary and can contain 1-, 2- or 3-dimensional data. The dimensionality can be read by #getDataPropertyInt(), etc.
Direct access to their memory is possible via #getDataPtr(), etc.
Data properties can be read out via #getDataPropertyInt(), #getDataPropertyFloat(), etc. These include sizes along their first, second and third axis, 
physical spacing between pixels, their total range, etc.

\subsection sec_OCTDeviceHandle OCTDeviceHandle 
A handle specifying the OCT device that is used. In most cases the #OCTDeviceHandle is obtained using the #initDevice() function and needs to be closed 
after using by #closeDevice(). The complete device will be initialized, the SLD will be switched on and all start-up dependent calibration will be performed.
All hardware and hardware dependend actions require the #OCTDeviceHandle to be passed. These include for example 
- starting and stopping a measurement (#startMeasurement() and #stopMeasurement())
- getting properties of the device (#getDevicePropertyInt() and #getDevicePropertyFloat())

\subsection sec_processinghandle ProcessingHandle
The numerics and processing routines required in order to create A-scans, B-scans and volumes out of directly measured spectra can be accessed via the #ProcessingHandle. 
When the #ProcessingHandle is created, all required temporary memory and routines are initialized and prepared and several threads are started.
In most cases the ideal way to create a processing handle is to use #createProcessingForDevice() which creates optimized processing algorithms for the #OCTDeviceHandle specified. 
If no device is available or the processing routines are to be tweaked manually #createProcessing() must be used. When all required processing is done, #closeProcessing 
must be used to stop all processing threads and free all temporary memory.
All functions whose output is dependent on the processing routines used have a #ProcessingHandle parameter. These include for example
- The #setProcessingParameterInt() and #setProcessingFlag() functions for setting parameters that are used for processing
- The #executeProcessing() function for triggering the processing of raw data

\subsection sec_probehandle ProbeHandle
The probe is the hardware used for scanning the sample, usually with help of galvanometric scanners. The object referenced by #ProbeHandle is 
responsible for creating scan patterns and holds all information and settings of the probe attached to the device. It needs to be calibrated to map suitable 
output voltage (for analog galvo drivers) or digital values (for digital galvo drivers) to scanning angles, inches or milimeters. In most cases this calibration data
is provided by *.ini files and the probe is initialized by #initProbe() where the probe configuration file name needs be specified as a string parameter.
Probes calibrated at Thorlabs will usually come with a factory-made probe configuration file which follows the nomenclature Probe + Objective Name.ini, e.g. "ProbeLSM03.ini"

If the probe is to be hardcoded into the software one can also provide an empty string as parameter and provide the configuration manually using the #setProbeParameterInt() 
and #setProbeParameterFloat() functions. When the Probe object is no longer needed, #closeProbe() must be called to free temporary memory.
All actions that depend on the probe configuration require a #ProbeHandle to be specified, such as:
- move galvo scanner to a specific position (#moveScanner()).
- create a scan pattern (#createBScanPattern()), see also \ref sec_scanpatternhandle. 
- set calibration parameters for a specific probe (#setProbeParameterFloat() and #setProbeParameterInt())

\subsection sec_scanpatternhandle ScanPatternHandle
A scan pattern is used to specifiy the points on the probe to scan during data acquisition, and its information is accessible via the #ScanPatternHandle. 
A dedicated function can be used to create a specific scan pattern, such as #createBScanPattern() for a simple B-scan or #createVolumePattern() for a simple volume scan. 
When the scan pattern is no longer needed its ressources can be freed using #clearScanPattern(). 
The #ScanPatternHandle needs to be specified to all functions that need information on the resulting scan. For example:
- creating a pattern (#createBScanPattern(), #createVolumePattern(), etc.)
- starting a measurement (#startMeasurement())

\subsection sec_otherhandles Other Handles
Other Handles that are used in the Spectral Radar SDK are
- #DopplerProcessingHandle: Handle to Doppler processing routines that can be used to transform complex data to Doppler phase and amplitude signals.
- #SettingsHandle: Handle to an INI file that can be read and written to without explicitly taking care of parsing the file.
- #Coloring32BitHandle: Handle to processing routines that can map floating point data to 32 bit color data. 

\section first_steps First Steps
The following section describes first steps that are needed to acquire data with the Spectral Radar SDK.
\subsection init Initializing The Device

The easiest way to initialize the device is to use the #initDevice() function. It returns an approprate #OCTDeviceHandle that can be used to identifiy the device:
\code
OCTDeviceHandle Dev = initDevice();
// Acquire data, processing, direct hardware access...
closeDevice(Dev);
\endcode

\subsection processing Creating Processing Routines
In most cases raw data acquired by the OCT device needs to be transformed usings a Fast Fourier transform and other pre- and postprocessing algorithms. 
To get a #ProcessingHandle on these algorithms the most convenient way is to use the #createProcessingForDevice() functionality which requires a valid #OCTDeviceHandle:
\code
// ...
ProcessingHandle Proc = createProcessingForDevice(Dev);
// acquire data and perform processing
closeProcessing(Proc);
// ...
\endcode

\subsection scanpattern Creating A Scan Pattern
In order to scan a sample and acquire B-scan OCT data one needs to specifiy a scan pattern that describes at which point to acquire data. To get the data of a 
simple B-Scan on can simply use #createBScanPattern():
\code 
// ...
ProbeHandle Probe = initProbe(Dev, "Probe"); 
ScanPatternHandle Pattern = createBScanPattern(Probe, 2.0, 512); // get B-scans with 2.0mm scanning angle and 512 A-scans per B-scan 
// acquire data, ...
clearScanPattern(Pattern);
closeProbe(Probe);
// ...
\endcode

\subsection Asynchronous Acquisition
The most convenient and fast way to acquire data is to acquire data asynchronously. For this one starts a measurement using #startMeasurement() and retrieves 
the latest available #getRawData(). The memory needed to store the data needs to be allocated first:
\code
int i;


RawDataHandle Raw = createRawData();
DataHandle BScan = createRealData();
startMeasurement(Dev, Pattern, Acquisition_ASyncContinuous);

for(i=0; i<1000; ++i) // get 1000 B-scans
{
    getRawData(Raw);
    setProcessedDataOutput(Proc, BScan);
    executeProcessing(Proc, Raw);
    // data is now in BScan...
    // do something with the data...
}

stopMeasurement(Dev);
clearData(BScan);
clearRawData(Raw);
\endcode

\section ErrorHandling Error Handling
Error handling is done by calling the function #getError(). The function will return an #ErrorCode and if the result is not NO_ERROR an error string 
will be provided giving details about the problem.
\code
#define ERROR_STRLEN 1024;
//...
char error[ERROR_STRLEN];
OCTDeviceHandle Dev = initDevice();
if(!getError(error, ERROR_STRLEN)) // check whether the previous calls to SDK functions caused an error
{
    printf("An error occurred: %s", error);
}
// ...
\endcode
